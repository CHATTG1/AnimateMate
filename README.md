##### *Haha, is this joke or what?! Why the heck do I need animation tools in Sketch.*

You know feeling when you just need a simple animation for your awesome concept and you realize that it's a huge process to move all assets into some other application? Thatâ€™s a lot of hassle! Like this example.

That's why I created AnimateMate in order to produce and export simple animations straight out of Sketch. It's not exactly rocket science, but it can lighten your workflow in some cases. 
So let the game begin!

You could run into a situation when you're wondering why it's working this or that way... This plugin does not convert your **Sketch** to a fully featured animation software :) However, it'll help you in many simple cases, but if you need more complex animations you should consider some other animation tools. **AnimateMate** was made for creating simple animations at least for now, we'll see how it'll develop in the future...

## About

I think **Sketch** is super useful in many design tasks. But while using Sketch and as well many other graphic design softwares I was always longing for the basic level of animation tools. Usually it's only the basic move-, rotation-, scale- or transparency animations that needed to visualise something simple.

I think most of the graphical design sofwares should include at least some very basic level of animation tools. Like in Photoshop I've nowadays found many good uses for animation tools. Too often it would be hard work to transfer all assets to other software just for creating simple animations. Still, it doesn't need to be such a complex system...
